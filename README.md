    Scala/SBT Builder
</h1>

Docker images for building Scala/SBT projects, with optional ScalaJS support.

Built on top of Alpine Linux with a few tricks to keep things small, and
contains a built-in workaround for the docker layer-caching bug in SBT. See
the Dockerfile for details.

## Installation

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Pull [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/openlaw/scala-builder/) from
public [Docker Hub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com):
```
docker pull openlaw/scala-builder
```

## Image Variants

_Note: only a single version of Scala/SBT is preinstalled on each image (see the
`SCALA_VERSION` and `SBT_VERSION` args), it is intended that projects will use a
standardized version. When using this as a base image in a project, be sure to
include the version tag and upgrade in lockstep with your scala/sbt versions in
the project._

### `openlaw/scala-builder:`, `openlaw/scala-builder:*-alpine`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you
probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away
container as well as the base to build other images off of.

### `openlaw/scala-builder:*-node`

Extends the base image with a LTS version of Node.js which is a build
environment dependency for ScalaJS projects.

Note that while this image contains Node.js, *it is provided strictly as a
dependency of ScalaJS*, and should never be used as a base image for node
projects. (For actual node projects, use an official node image as the builder
for much better results).

## Usage

```
$ docker run -it --rm openlaw/scala-builder
```

By default the WORKDIR is set to `/src`, so if you want to mount local code you
can do something like:

    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src openlaw/scala-builder sbt compile

## Release process

The CI system will automatically build and release anything with a Semantic
Version tag to Docker Hub. Please use GitHub Releases to mark the release.
